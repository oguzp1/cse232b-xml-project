<SPEAKER>CASSIUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Messala,</LINE>
<LINE>This is my birth-day; as this very day</LINE>
<LINE>Was Cassius born. Give me thy hand, Messala:</LINE>
<LINE>Be thou my witness that against my will,</LINE>
<LINE>As Pompey was, am I compell'd to set</LINE>
<LINE>Upon one battle all our liberties.</LINE>
<LINE>You know that I held Epicurus strong</LINE>
<LINE>And his opinion: now I change my mind,</LINE>
<LINE>And partly credit things that do presage.</LINE>
<LINE>Coming from Sardis, on our former ensign</LINE>
<LINE>Two mighty eagles fell, and there they perch'd,</LINE>
<LINE>Gorging and feeding from our soldiers' hands;</LINE>
<LINE>Who to Philippi here consorted us:</LINE>
<LINE>This morning are they fled away and gone;</LINE>
<LINE>And in their steads do ravens, crows and kites,</LINE>
<LINE>Fly o'er our heads and downward look on us,</LINE>
<LINE>As we were sickly prey: their shadows seem</LINE>
<LINE>A canopy most fatal, under which</LINE>
<LINE>Our army lies, ready to give up the ghost.</LINE>
